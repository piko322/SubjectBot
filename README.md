# SubjectBot
SubjectBot for Discord that I originally wrote in 2020 to help me with navigating online learning through high school during the COVID lockdown

## Current goals:
- Convert the bot for me to use during my study at UCSD

## TODO:
- Add a function to accept a URL to the webregMain.pdf from users, read it, and store it in a pickledb
- For each weekday, use a linkedlist to implement the class reminder function of iterating through the classes in a day
